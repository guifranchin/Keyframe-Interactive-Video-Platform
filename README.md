# Keyframe: Interactive Video Platform

Keyframe is a video sharing platform that promotes interaction between users through comments and recommendations of popular videos. The platform aims to solve problems faced by other video sharing platforms, such as lack of competition, privacy, and freedom, by offering a more professional and organized user experience. 

The project is developed with Node.js and TypeORM on the back-end, utilizing a PostgreSQL database, and React on the front-end. The platform includes a video upload area and an area of interaction between users in the system.
